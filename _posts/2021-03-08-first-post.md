## Obligatory "why I created this blog" first post.

At first, I wanted to create my own blog from the scratch. I opened my terminal, executed a new React application and gave up when I looked at the framework icon. I thought about how many front-end related things I would have to write and just closed everything.       

But now I'm using this template that does everything that I need: write about random things that comes to my mind.

I'm creating this blog because I want to leave my thoughts on philosophy, computers and science on the internet. I also like to talk about my personal projects.        

As I'm still not a influencer with 1kk followers (my life goal), I won't be an active poster. For now, I'm just doing it for fun, but I'm sure that this will be frequently read in a couple of years.
